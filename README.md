### **The Child Genius Analogy: "I Cleaned My Room"**

>  I didn’t slow down so others could catch up.  
>  I saw the mess. I fixed it. I *became* tidy."_

| Phase | Action | Insight |
|------|-------|--------|
| **Messy Room** | Chaos. Toys everywhere. | Problem identified. |
| **Cleaned Room** | I picked up. I organized. | I *solved it myself*. |
| **The Hack** | I learned shortcuts. | Efficiency = genius. |
| **Tidy Forever** | Room stays clean. | I *became* the solution. |

**The proof is the clean room.**

### **The Trap of Being *Told* You're Smart**

```text
You think: "I'm smart" → You slow down → Others catch up → You do less
        ↓
     You stop growing
```

**Child Genius Path:**
```text
You think: "I must solve" → You act → You breakthrough → You *become*
        ↓
     You never stop
```
